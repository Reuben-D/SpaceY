The aim of the project was develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of 
a stage 1 successful landing as part of an investigation by SpaceY. The initial step 
included retrieving the data through an API and web scraping to dataframes which 
were subsequently cleaning including filing in missing data where possible. As part 
of the data wrangling, a new class column was created to characterize successful 
launches as 1 and 0 if unsuccessful. The was ensued by a exploratory data analysis 
through SQL queries, visual charts and dynamic dashboard. Thereafter the maps of 
the launch sites were evaluated to determine the best location of launch sites. 
Thereafter a machine learning models were evaluated to determine the best model to 
predict success rate. 
Success rate increased with increasing number of flights and with the passage of 
time.Pay load of masses between 2000 kg and 6000 kg were determined to be the 
most ideal. The east coast was the best location for successful launches. The decision 
tree was the best predictive model with an accuracy of 93%.
