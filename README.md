## Executive Summary  
The aim of the project was develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of 
a stage 1 successful landing as part of an investigation by a fictional company SpaceY. 

The initial step included retrieving the data through an API and web scraping to dataframes which 
were subsequently cleaned including filling in missing data where possible. As part 
of data wrangling, a new class column was created to characterize successful 
launches as 1 and 0 if unsuccessful. This was followed by an exploratory data analysis 
through SQL queries, visual charts and dynamic dashboard to get a better understanding of the data. Thereafter the maps of 
the launch sites were evaluated to determine the best location of launch sites.
Thereafter several machine learning models were used to predict successful landings and were then evaluated to determine the best model to 
predict success rate. 

Success rate increased with increasing number of flights and with the passage of 
time.Pay load of masses between 2000 kg and 6000 kg were determined to be the 
most ideal. The east coast was the best location for successful launches. The decision 
tree was the best predictive model with an accuracy of 93%.
